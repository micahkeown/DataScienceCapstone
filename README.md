# 🚀 Data Science Capstone Project: SpaceX Launch Analysis

Welcome to my capstone project for the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** program!

In this project, I analyzed real-world data related to **SpaceX launches** to help a fictional competitor better understand SpaceX's performance in returning rocket stages after spaceflight. The goal was to uncover the key factors that influence the **success of rocket landings**, using the tools and techniques learned throughout the certificate.

## 📊 Project Objective

To help a fictional company gain insights into how SpaceX successfully returns rocket stages and what variables are most critical to that success. This includes:
- Extracting and cleaning launch data
- Performing exploratory data analysis
- Visualizing key trends and patterns
- Building machine learning models to **predict landing success**

## 🧠 Skills & Tools Used

### Languages & Libraries
- **Python**
  - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Scikit-Learn
  - Dash (for interactive visualizations)
- **SQL** for data querying and analysis

### Tools
- Jupyter Notebooks
- IBM Watson Studio
- Git & GitHub
